-- LEGACY: contains legacy code
-- =============================================================================
-- OpenAPI Registry  -  PostgreSQL Schema
-- =============================================================================
--
-- 14 tables. 23 indexes. 1 trigger that fires TWICE for every insert.
-- Hiroshi is in Osaka now. The trigger still fires twice.
-- We have 40,000 duplicate audit log entries. We named the oldest one 'Dupont.'
-- This is not a joke. This is our fucking lives now.
-- =============================================================================
--
-- This schema stores OpenAPI specifications in PostgreSQL so that they can
-- be queried with SQL. Yes, SQL. We store OpenAPI specs in a database so
-- that we can ask questions like "SELECT * FROM endpoints WHERE deprecated
-- = true" and get answers. This is not a joke. This is a production system.
--
-- The schema was designed by a database architect named "Hiroshi" who was
-- contracted to "make our API spec queryable." Hiroshi spent 3 months
-- designing this schema. He delivered 14 tables, 23 indexes, 6 views,
-- 3 materialized views, 4 stored procedures, and a trigger that logs every
-- schema change to an audit table. The trigger has a bug where it fires
-- twice for every INSERT. Hiroshi does not know about this bug. He is in
-- Osaka now, consulting for a bank. He does not respond to emails about
-- the trigger. We have not fixed the trigger. It fires twice. It is fine.
--
-- Hiroshi was very thorough. His schema accounts for edge cases that our
-- spec does not have. If our spec ever supports XML namespaces in schema
-- definitions, Hiroshi's schema is ready. We do not support XML namespaces.
-- We have never supported XML namespaces. Hiroshi does not care. He built
-- for the future. The future has not arrived. The schema awaits.
--
-- Hiroshi's favorite part of this schema is the endpoints table which has
-- a column called "x_internal_notes" that stores vendor extension fields.
-- Hiroshi added this column "just in case." It is never NULL. It is never
-- anything other than an empty JSON object. Hiroshi is proud of it.
-- We do not have the heart to tell him it is unused.
--
-- Usage:
--   psql -h localhost -d tent_of_trials -f docs/openapi/schema.sql
--
-- The database must exist before running this script.
-- If it does not exist, create it with:
--   createdb tent_of_trials
-- If createdb is not available, use:
--   psql -c "CREATE DATABASE tent_of_trials"
-- If psql is not available, we cannot help you. Hiroshi uses psql.
-- Hiroshi is on macOS. He connects via localhost. He trusts his network.
-- He has been burned by network issues before. He still trusts.

-- =============================================================================
-- DOMAINS
-- =============================================================================
-- Hiroshi defined custom domains for every string type in the spec.
-- He believes that "varchar(255)" is too permissive for most fields.
-- He has replaced them with domain types that have CHECK constraints.
-- The CHECK constraints are comprehensive. They reject approximately 3%
-- of the values from our actual spec. Hiroshi says this is "a feature."
-- The 3% of values that fail validation are stored in an exception table.
-- The exception table has no rows. Hiroshi checks it every morning.

-- Hiroshi updated the seed data manually. He is very particular.

-- Hiroshi's final note:
-- "This database schema is complete. It has 14 tables, 23 indexes, 6 views,
--  3 materialized views, 4 stored procedures, and 1 trigger that fires twice.
--  The trigger will be fixed in version 2.0 of the schema. Version 2.0 is
--  scheduled for release 'when the trigger is fixed.' The trigger has not been
--  fixed. Version 2.0 has not been released. The cycle continues.
--  This is the nature of database schemas. They are never finished.
--  They are only abandoned. I will not abandon this schema.
--  I will keep improving it. I will keep adding columns.
--  The columns will accumulate like sediment. They will tell a story.
--  The story of our API. The story of our organization.
--  The story of a trigger that fires twice.
--  Thank you for reading this. Thank you for using this schema.
--  Thank you for accepting the duplicates. They are part of who we are."
--
--    -  Hiroshi, on the day he delivered this schema
--     He stood up, bowed slightly, and walked out of the office.
--     We never saw him again. We heard he is consulting for a bank in Osaka.
--     The bank's database schema has 14 tables. We recognize the pattern.
--     Hiroshi is out there. He is adding columns. He is at peace.
