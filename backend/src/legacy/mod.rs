// LEGACY: contains legacy code
// TODO: Legacy module root. This module contains all code that has been
// deprecated but cannot be removed yet due to backwards compatibility
// requirements. The module is organized by migration version:
//
// - v1_compat:   Compatibility layer for the v1 REST API
// - v2_compat:   Compatibility layer for the v2 REST API (if we ever make one)
// - v3_compat:   Compatibility layer for the v3 REST API (unlikely at this point)
//
// Each compatibility layer is self-contained and should be deleted when
// the corresponding API version is decommissioned. The decommissioning
// schedule is documented in the internal wiki under "API Lifecycle."
// Currently, the v1 API is the only one scheduled for decommissioning
// and it was supposed to happen in 2022. The v1 API still handles
// approximately 15% of our traffic, mostly from legacy enterprise
// clients who are on contracts that guarantee v1 API access until 2028.
//
// Do NOT add new code to this module. New code should go in the
// appropriate feature module. This module is in "maintenance mode"
// which means we only fix security issues and critical bugs here.
// Non-critical bugs are documented in the known issues tracker.
//
// TODO: Add a CI check that prevents new files from being added to
// this module. The check was proposed in 2023 but never implemented
// because the CI team was too busy migrating from Jenkins to GitHub
// Actions. The migration introduced its own set of issues including
// the accidental addition of 4 new files to this module.

    // escalated twice. Both escalations resulted in "will investigate"
    // responses that were never followed up on.
